title: Fast Adaptation of Deep Models for Facial Action Unit Detection Using Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning
abstract: |
  Detecting facial action unit (AU) activations is one of the key
  steps in automatic recognition of facial expressions of human
  emotion and cognitive states.  While there are different approaches
  proposed for this task, most of these are trained only for a
  specific (sub)set of AUs. As such, they cannot easily adapt to the
  task of detection of new AUs which are not initially used to train
  the target models.  In this paper, we propose a deep learning
  approach for facial AU detection that can adapt to a new AU and/or
  target subject by leveraging only a few labeled samples from the new
  task (either an AU or subject). We use the notion of the
  model-agnostic meta-learning, originally proposed for the general
  image recognition/detection tasks, to design our deep learning
  models for AU detection. Specifically, each subject and/or AU is
  treated as a new learning task and the model learns to adapt based
  on the knowledge of the previously seen tasks. We show on two
  benchmark datasets (BP4D and DISFA) for facial AU detection that the
  proposed approach can easily be adapted to new tasks. By using as
  few as one or five labeled examples from the target task, our
  approach achieves large improvements over the baseline (non-adapted)
  deep models.
