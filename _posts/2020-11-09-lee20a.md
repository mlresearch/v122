title: 'Fast Adaptation of Deep Models for Facial Action Unit
Detection Using Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning'
abstract: Detecting facial action unit (AU) activations is one of the key steps in
  automatic recognition of facial expressions of human emotion and cognitive states.
  While there are different approaches proposed for this task, most of these are trained
  only for a specific (sub)set of AUs. As such, they cannot easily adapt to the task
  of detection of new AUs which are not initially used to train the target models.
  In this paper, we propose a deep learning approach for facial AU detection that
  can adapt to a new AU and/or target subject by leveraging only a few labeled samples
  from the new task (either an AU or subject). We use the notion of the model-agnostic
  meta-learning, originally proposed for the general image recognition/detection tasks,
  to design our deep learning models for AU detection. Specifically, each subject
  and/or AU is treated as a new learning task and the model learns to adapt based
  on the knowledge of the previously seen tasks. We show on two benchmark datasets
  (BP4D and DISFA) for facial AU detection that the proposed approach can easily be
  adapted to new tasks. By using as few as one or five labeled examples from the target
  task, our approach achieves large improvements over the baseline (non-adapted) deep
  models.
