title: 'Persuasion: What Jane Austin Would Have Written'
abstract: 'This paper presents preliminary results for developing an online "persuasion
  score" that will enable digital marketing content authors to compose and edit materials
  with better persuasive capability.  Inspired by initial insights with digital marketing
  professionals and research on the foundations of persuasion: pathos, ethos and logos,
  we extracted features from a data set of over three million consumer reactions to
  email marketing campaigns covering a three month period.  We report on the most
  significant features of the content, including image position and text readability
  as well as the most salient customer features such as time since registration and
  time since last opened email from the same marketing brand.'
